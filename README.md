# football-play-simulator
Simulates a play in American football. Lets you pick both offensive and defensive formation, what play each side calls and runs, game situation (down and distance, quarter, time remaining, etc), and how "skilled" each player on each side of the ball is. The output is the simulated result of the play (e.g. gain of 4, loss of 3, touchdown, fumble, etc.).
